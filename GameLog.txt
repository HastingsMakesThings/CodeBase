Made start on Collision Manager, got detection almost done need to add more constraints so when left or right collision is detected top or bottom does get actiavted either.
TODO

Removed previous atempt at collision and started to implement seperating axis theorem. However the Y axis collision is not as accurate and you are required to fully cover the Y axis before collision is detected.

Fixed Y axis collision by getting the distance instead of using Rectangle.intersect. Distance checking is now in place so you can set a preffered distance to start collision detection, I also have the impulse calculation sorted. The x/y impulse methods now return a number the player needs to be moved by.
